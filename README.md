# Welcome to ZAFAR WARIS/Programming repository.

In this repository I would help you improve your programming skills. I will help build up your knowledge required in coding, developing, playing with data and much more. And it will always be free, so you don't have to worry about anything else except yourself. It's my way to return to the community that has helped me over the years. So, you could just sit back and make use of the content as per your desire.

# What and How?

This tutorial believes that you are not starting from scratch and know the basics of programming. I will try to make the content as beginner friendly as possible but it would be best if you already have some basic knowledge of how a program works. The content will include examples as well as test questions which I will be providing answers of. But it is recommended to only look at the answers after you try to answer the questions first by yourselves. I will also include some DSA concepts within the content so you may understand where and how those Data Structures are used and how the algorithms work in sync with the programs. 

The tutorial will mainly be based on two  languages i.e - Python and JAVA but you can expect to see some GOlang too. This would be useful for all those learners who are in the initial stages of coding because it's all about syntax of the language. Now since we have finished What of the tutorial let us get familiar with the How.

The tutorial will comprise of less theory and more coding. As the tutorial expects that you already know how to write code there will not be any problem in understanding the code written. The content will be briefly explained whereever necessary but will not dive into the details. The tutorial will be having 45 listed contents maximum and will try to explain as completely as possible for everyone to begin and understand coding. I will add some reference books or videos that you can visit or study for the detailed explanation.

If you find any typo in the contents published or would like to add something that you think is missing feel free to mail me at: <a href="mailto: bus.zmw@gmail.com"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zmwaris1/logos/main/Gmail.svg" alt="GMail" height="25" width="25"></a><br> or raise an issue regarding the same. If you find the content useful give a star, share the content and help others to learn.

I thank you for your patience and support.
